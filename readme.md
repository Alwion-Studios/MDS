# MDS

## Melly Data System

The Melly Data System is a new OOP-based database system for Roblox.

MDS was designed to be efficient, tiny and readable. MDS uses a system of schemas to give you access to custom method as well as custom property creation.

MDS can be used for both user data and system data. MDS is widely adopted as a way to store user data.
